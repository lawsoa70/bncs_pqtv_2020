      BNCS DRIVER APPLICATION : MemoryAuto
========================================================================

This is the information file for the BNCS Project MemoryAuto which the BNCS Driver AppWizard
has created for you.

The project may require the pre-installation of some of the libraries and header files pertaining
to the serial port class, network client class, external infodriver class, CSI connection classes,
external grd class:

extinfo.lib	[extinfodb.lib] <extinfo.h>
csicln.lib [csiclndb.lib] <csiclient.h>

and also the standard BNCS header files:

<bbc_mxc.h>   <bncs.h>	<bncs32.h>	<bncsdef.h>

This text file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your MemoryAuto application.

////////////
main.cpp 
////////////
	This contains the shell Win32 application for a BNCS Infodriver external driver
	Functions within this application set up the following standard .ini file settings:
			debug flag for on-screen diagnostics

You can use the (global) function void Debug(LPCSTR szFmt, ...) to print to the debug window.

////////////////////
MemoryAuto.cpp 
////////////////////
	Callback functions are provided in this .cpp file:

	For infodriver events:
		void InfoNotify(extinfo* pex,UINT iSlot,LPCSTR szSlot);
		
		If the connection is valid, this function calls:

		BOOL SlotChange(UINT iDevice,UINT iSlot, LPCSTR szSlot);

		You should insert code here pertaining to the processing of slot change messages.
		There is some example code already present, which can be used/removed as required.

	The other library functions are described in the documentation for the respective classes.

////////////////////
MemoryAuto_x.cpp 
////////////////////
	Sample extra .cpp file for additional driver-specific functions
	If you don't need it, delete it.

MemoryAuto.dsp
    This file (the project file) contains information at the project level and
    is used to build a single project or subproject. Other users can share the
    project (.dsp) file, but they should export the makefiles locally.

MemoryAuto.dsw
	This file is the workspace file and it references the project file.
	
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
BNCS Driver Wizard has created the following resources:

MemoryAuto.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Windows resources that the program uses.
	It includes the icons, bitmaps, etc. This file can be directly edited in 
	Visual C++. It contains	VERSIONINFO data with the author name supplied 
	during the creation of this project. The author name is also inserted 
	into the ABOUT dialog.

MemoryAuto.ico
    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon (32x32).
    This icon is included by the main resource file MemoryAuto.rc.

small.ico
    This is an icon file, which contains a smaller version (16x16)
	of the application's icon. This icon is included by the main resource
	file MemoryAuto.rc.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named MemoryAuto.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

MemoryAuto.h
	This file is the header file for the application, containing function 
	prototypes, and macro definitions, constant #defines etc.
	Place all global variables and global function prototypes here.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file.
